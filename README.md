Title:  On the Bust of Helen by Canova

 In this belov√©d marble view
  Above the works and thoughts of Man,
What Nature _could_ but _would not_ do,
  And Beauty and Canova _can!_
Beyond Imagination's power,
  Beyond the Bard's defeated art,
With Immortality her dower,
  Behold the _Helen_ of the heart.
```
